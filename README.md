# PeachTreeBank

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.
My motivation while creating the project was to show my skills from the best side. I chose Angular based on my knowledge and experience. Despite the lack of backend, I tried to reflect the condition of a professional, commercial project. I gave up the use of libraries, i.e. bootstrap. Instead, I created my own grid, based on bootstrap class names - obviously in a truncated version. Due to the fact that you need a Web Server to run the application, the demo is available online.
The core of the functionality (adding new transaction) is based on rxjs BehaviourSubject emitting the transactions array. 
The class names are base on BEM methodology.

## Demo

Live demo is available [here](http://peachtreebank.sohostudio.pl/). 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
